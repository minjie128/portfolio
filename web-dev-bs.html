        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Whenever you talk about the future of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) is always high on the agenda. But right now, I think it is actually justified. A lot of advances have been made in the field of AI in the last year.</p>
          <p><b>AlphaGo, a program built by Google DeepMind, became the first program beat a professional Go player.</b></p>
          <p>Some of the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook, have been releasing their AI technology to be used by the public. Artificial intelligence is already used by large applications, either to improve search engines, like in Google’s case, or in Wikipedia's case to identify inaccurate or damaged articles.</p>
          <p>With easier access to the necessary tools for AI development, we can expect developers to start using AI in new and different ways in the new year.</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Another topic that always seems to surface when discussing the future of technology is virtual reality or VR. This trend has already started to sweep the gaming industry. The Oculus Rift and the Vive bring new and interesting possibilities to the world of gaming, but it won’t stop there.</p>
          <p>Companies including Google and Mozilla have begun work on APIs to help VR technology transition to the web. As standards develop, we expect more and more applications to be developed using VR technologies.</p>
          <p><b>In the coming year, we'll see virtual reality in various applications, ranging from news coverage, to virtual real estate tours.</b></p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>The internet of things is a movement where typically non-internet-connected objects are given network connectivity in order to send and receive data. These objects can range from your toaster or kettle, to sensors on motors or sensors embedded in concrete to detect cracks and weaknesses.</p>
          <p>Web developers may not be directly involved in the creation of such devices. However, it's likely we'll be involved in the development of applications that use, analyse and display the devices’ data. Companies such as Xively and BugLabs have already started working on APIs that can be used by developers to communicate with IoT devices.</p>
          <p>Though IoT brings a lot of opportunity for innovation, some concerns have been raised, especially around security. <b>No doubt web developers will have interesting challenges to face - helping to protect our fittings and furnishings from hackers.</b></p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Or as Casey Newton from TheVerge wrote:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Bots are here, they’re learning — and in 2016, they might eat the web</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>If you sign up for a new Slack account, a so-called Slackbot welcomes and on-boards you. The Slackbot not only asks you for your name (which is then automatically saved in your slack account) but for some other things as well.</p>
          <p>It’s not only Slack. Bots are popping up in many more of our beloved tools and apps, whether it’s Facebook, Telegram or WeChat. It feels like the beginning of a new era, an era full of different bots, all making our life easier.</p>

          <h3 class="panel-title">Web design evolution</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>If you're interested in design, here are a few trends to watch out for next year:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Movement based interfaces will probably become a staple on the web. Perhaps when combined with libraries such as tracking.js, interfaces that respond to hand movements could be closer than we think.</li>
            <li>Bolder and larger typography is likely to become more prevalent.</li>
            <li>People often want engaging and compelling ways to get their information quickly. This will likely elicit a rise in the use of videos and other storytelling visuals.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The web is an interesting place, where nothing stands still for too long. Information is always changing and the methods we use to deal with that information will always evolve along with it.</p>
          <p>2017 is likely to bring some very interesting developments in web technologies, and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing what it holds in store for us! </p>

        <h1>Little Known Facts</h1>
        <p>If you truly want to understand the web design process, you must look beyond just the outward visual appearance of a website. Very few visitors consider what happens behind the scenes of a website, as different web browsers interpret code to display that site on the screen. Extra milliseconds of loading time, browser variations, the age of the code, and the content itself can completely change a user’s experience and resulting behaviors on a website. Let’s take a look behind the curtain to learn about some of the most surprising and amazing aspects of web design.</p>

                      <p>Codecademy is an education company. But not one in the way you might think. We're committed to building the best learning experience inside and out, making Codecademy the best place for our team to learn, teach, and create the online learning experience of the future.</p>
                      <p>Education is old. The current public school system in the US dates back to the 19th century and wasn't designed to scale the way it has. Lots of companies are working to "disrupt" education by changing the way things work in the classroom and by bringing the classroom online.</p>
                      <h5>Our Mission</h5>
                      <p>We're not one of those companies. We are rethinking education from the bottom up. The web has rethought nearly everything - commerce, social networking, healthcare, and more. We are building the education the world needs - the first truly net native education. We take more cues from Facebook and Zynga in creating an engaging educational experience than we do from the classroom.</p>
                      <p>Education is broken. Come help us build the education the world deserves.</p>

                      <p>Education is no longer a one-time event but a lifelong experience. Education should be less passive listening (no long lectures) and more active doing. Education should empower students to succeed not just in school but in life.</p>
                      <h5>University by Industry</h5>
                      <p>We are building an online university, "by Silicon Valley", that:</p>
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
                          <li>teaches the skills that industry employers need today</li>

                          <li>educates at a fraction of the cost of traditional schools</li>
                        </ul>
                      <p>With industry giants — Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Cloudera, etc.— we offer Nanodegree programs and credentials, designed so professionals become Web Developers, Data Analysts, Mobile Developers, etc. Our students acquire real skills through a series of online courses and hands-on projects.</p>
                      <h5>Our Story</h5>
                      <p>Udacity was born out of a Stanford University experiment in which Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig offered their "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" course online to anyone, for free. Over 160,000 students in more than 190 countries enrolled and not much later, Udacity was born. Now we're a growing team of educators and engineers on a mission to change the future of education by bridging the gap between real-world skills, relevant education, and employment.</p>

              <p>by Douglas Crockford</p>
              <p>Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.</p>

              <p>by Jon Duckett</p>
              <p>Every day, more and more people want to learn some HTML and CSS. Joining the professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a little bit of code at work (update a content management system or e-commerce store) and those who want to make their personal blogs more attractive. Many books teaching HTML and CSS are dry and only written for those who want to become programmers, which is why this book takes an entirely new approach.</p>

              <p>by Marijn Haverbeke</p>
              <p>Eloquent JavaScript goes beyond the cut-and-paste scripts of the recipe books and teaches you to write code that's elegant and effective. You'll start with the basics of programming, and learn to use variables, control structures, functions, and data structures. Then you'll dive into the real JavaScript artistry: higher-order functions, closures, and object-oriented programming.</p>

              <p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could edit your HTML and CSS in real-time, or debug your JavaScript, all while viewing a thorough performance analysis of your website?</p>
              <p>Google’s built-in Chrome Developer Tools let you do just that. Bundled and available in both Chrome and Safari, they allow developers access into the internals of their web application. On top of this, a palette of network tools can help optimize your loading flows, while a timeline gives you a deeper understanding of what the browser is doing at any given moment.</p>
              <p>Google release an update every six weeks – so check out their <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en">website</a> as well as the Google Developers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers">YouTube</a> channel to keep your skillset up-to date.</p>

              <p>It’s every developer’s worst nightmare – you’re working on a new project feature and you screw up. Enter version control systems (VCS) – and more specifically, GitHub.</p>
              <p>By rolling out your project with the service, you can view any changes you’ve made or even go back to your previous state (making pesky mistakes a thing of the past). The repository hosting service also boasts a rich open-source development community (making collaboration between teams as easy as pie), as well as providing several other components such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.</p>
              <p>Many employers will look for finely honed Git skills, so now’s the perfect time to sign up – plus it’s a great way to get involved and learn from the best with a wide array of open-source projects to work on.</p>

              <p>Getting tired of typing in that same styling for a container? How about that button that keeps cropping up? Once you start building front-end applications regularly, you’ll start to notice the same patterns emerging.</p>
              <p>UI frameworks are an attempt to solve these problems by abstracting the common elements into reusable modules - meaning developers can scaffold the elements of new applications with speed and ease.</p>
              <p>The most widely used of these frameworks is Bootstrap, a comprehensive UI package developed by the team at Twitter. Complete with tools to normalize stylesheets, build modal objects, add JavaScript plugins, and a plethora of other features, Bootstrap can dramatically cut down on the amount of code (and time) needed to build your project.</p>
