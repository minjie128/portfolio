      <h2>Hi there! My name is Jie Min (pronounced "Jee-eh Meen").</h2>
      <img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="Profile picture">
      <p>I'm currently a UX Designer at Expeditors, helping them build the Customs and Compliance system. I graduated from the University of Washington's Master of Science in Information Management (MSIM) program, where I studied user centered design, information architectue, user research, usability tests and data visualization.</p>
      <p>As Don Norman said, “The new me is beauty.” I enjoy making things neat and fun as well as the wonderful process of generating projects from concepts to deliverables.I am always seeking opportunities to learn from other designers in the User Experience field and am working very hard to develop myself as a "full stack" designer in the future.</p>
