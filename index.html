      <h2>Hi there! My name is Jie Min (pronounced "Jee-eh Meen").</h2>
      <img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="Profile picture">
      <p>I'm currently a UX Designer at Expeditors, helping them build the Customs and Compliance system. I graduated from the University of Washington's Master of Science in Information Management (MSIM) program, where I studied user centered design, information architectue, user research, usability tests and data visualization.</p>
      <p>As Don Norman said, “The new me is beauty.” I enjoy making things neat and fun as well as the wonderful process of generating projects from concepts to deliverables. I am always seeking opportunities to learn from other designers in the User Experience field and am working very hard to develop myself as a "full stack" designer in the future.</p>
