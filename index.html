        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Hi there! My name is Jie Min (pronounced "Jee-eh Meen").</h3>
        <img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="Profile picture" id="profile-picture">
        <p class="about-me">I am currently a UX Designer at Expeditors, helping them build the Customs and Compliance system. I graduated from the University of Washington's Master of Science in Information Management (MSIM) program, where I studied user centered design, information architectue, user research, usability tests and data visualization.</p>
        <p class="about-me">As Don Norman said, “The new me is beauty.” I enjoy making things neat and fun as well as the wonderful process of generating projects from concepts to deliverables. I am always seeking opportunities to learn from other designers in the User Experience field and am working very hard to develop myself as a "full stack" designer in the future.</p>
